## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Henry Blackwell!

I am currently studying a Bachelor of Biomedical Engineering and a Bachelor of Science at the University of Sydney. This semester I am an exchange student at the University of Edinburgh and whilst here I am looking forward to learning more about:
- Bioinformatics
- Operations Management
- Molecular Genetics

With these new skills I hope to be able to further my own personal development for when I return to Australia. 

Back home I am looking to develop my professional skills in Engineering through an internship program, that will hopefully lead to further growth.
